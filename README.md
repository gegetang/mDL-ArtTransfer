Deep Learning Art Transfer using Multiple AIs

After the "Convolutional Neural Networks" course at Coursera (Deeplearning.ai specialization) I compared the script from Week4: Face recognition and Neural style transfer, practice Neural Style Transfer with other three algorithms for the same task. Therefore, this git is a benchmark of AI Art Transfer results usinng default parameters using four sources:

1) Coursera     : https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks
2) fchollet     : https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py
3) anishathalye : https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style
4) ShafeenTejani: https://github.com/ShafeenTejani/style-transfer

Due to the agreement to not use the practice code in any public repository, the Coursera scipts will have only my modifications. For using the entire code from Coursera you should graduate the course.

Still working, brb!
