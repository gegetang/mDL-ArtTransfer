# mDL-ArtTransfer
Deep Learning Art Transfer using Multiple AIs

After the "Convolutional Neural Networks" course at Coursera (Deeplearning.ai specialization) I compared the script from Week4: Face recognition and Neural style transfer, practice Neural Style Transfer with other three algorithms for the same task. Therefore, this git is a benchmark of AI Art Transfer results usinng default parameters using four sources:

1) Coursera     : https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks
2) fchollet     : https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py
3) anishathalye : https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style
4) ShafeenTejani: https://github.com/ShafeenTejani/style-transfer

NOTE: Due to the agreement to not use the practice code in any public repository, the Coursera scipts will have only my modifications. For using the entire code from Coursera you should graduate the course.

AI Art Transfer: Content image + Style image & AI algorithm ==> Generated image

I used 15 images as styles: the one used in other repository, my own paintings (10-years old), Romanian art and money and my ORCID QR code.

Still working, brb!
